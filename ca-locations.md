# DESCRIPTION

The following is a list of certificate authority file locations used by various
tools installed via Homebrew. If using a self-signed SSL certificate (i.e.Â from
a company proxy), it must be appended/added to each of these locations:

## OpenSSL

Add certificate to `/usr/local/etc/openssl/certs/` and run

```
/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash
```

Likewise for `openssl@1.1`.

## Python

The default Python that ships with macOS uses the macOS Keychain, so if your
certificate is already installed there you should not have any problems.
Python3 installed via Homebrew _should_ use the Homebrew `openssl` library,
which means Step 1 should be sufficient; however, some Homebrew packages ship
with their own version of Python (for isolation/virtualenv reasons), so they
too must be updated.

To find the location of this CA file, run `python -m certifi` using the Python
executable shipped with the Homebrew package. For example, using the `buku`
package:

```
/usr/local/Cellar/buku/<version>/libexec/bin/python -m certifi
```

yields

```
/usr/local/Cellar/buku/<version>/libexec/lib/python3.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem
```

## Homebrew

Depending on the version of Ruby that Homebrew uses this may or not be
necessary. Run `brew config` and check the value of **Homebrew Ruby**. For
example, if you see

```
Homebrew Ruby: 2.6.3 => /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.3/bin/ruby
```

then the `cert.pem` file can be found at

```
/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Homebrew/vendor/portable-ruby/2.6.3/libexec/cert.pem
```
